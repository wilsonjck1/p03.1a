"""
Problem:

    The function add_100 should add all the numbers from
    1 to 100 and print the total.

    The function contains the first few lines of a (very poor)
    implementation but whoever wrote it clearly got bored and
    gave up with their attempts.

    Rewrite and finish it using a loop.


Test:

    >>> add_100()
    5050

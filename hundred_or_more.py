Problem:

    The function add_to_n works in exactly the same way as
    the add_100 function from the previous problem.

    However, the difference here is that it allows us to
    specify the biggest number we want to add.


Tests:

    >>> add_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> add_to_n(500)
    125250
    >>> add_to_n(1234)
    761995

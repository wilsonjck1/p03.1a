Problem:

    The function print_nines should print the nine times
    table, from 9 to 63.

    The function already works, but the implementation
    is shoddy. Rewrite the code using a loop.

Test:

    >>> print_nines()
    1 x 9 = 9
    2 x 9 = 18
    3 x 9 = 27
    4 x 9 = 36
    5 x 9 = 45
    6 x 9 = 54
    7 x 9 = 63
